# OCLP-CustoMac

### Focused Modern Wi-Fi and AppleHDA root patching for macOS

---

OCLP-CustoMac is an independent, focused OpenCore Legacy Patcher derivative developed primarily for advanced Custom Mac and Hackintosh systems. Its first public release is fully runtime validated on **macOS Tahoe 26.x / Darwin 25**.

Current release: **[OCLP-CustoMac 3.0.3 — macOS Tahoe](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/OCLP-CustoMac/releases/latest)**

Version 3.0.3 is a focused build/package integrity maintenance release correcting an inherited **Build and Install OpenCore** payload-composition mismatch. The stale frozen payload resource set dates back to public 3.0.0 and was inherited unchanged by 3.0.1 and 3.0.2. Normal CustoMac Root Patching was unaffected.

Version 3.0.3 adds payload/component coherence safeguards: current component archive paths are derived from the source configuration, the actual contained OpenCore version is verified, and a stale or incompatible `payloads.dmg` is rejected or safely regenerated before it can be embedded in an application or package.

The registered root-patch families are deliberately limited to:

- **Modern Wireless**
- **Modern Audio / AppleHDA**

No graphics, Non-Metal, or unrelated inherited OCLP root-patch family is registered. The inherited OCLP source infrastructure remains present, but those other detector families cannot enter OCLP-CustoMac's final root-patch plan. The same narrow registry applies if OCLP-CustoMac is executed on genuine Apple Intel hardware.

## AMFI Configuration — Important

The validated OCLP-CustoMac configuration uses:

**`AMFIPass.kext` 1.4.1 + boot argument `-amfipassbeta`**

`amfi=0x80` is not required for the validated OCLP-CustoMac configuration.

OCLP-CustoMac does not automatically install, remove, or rewrite `AMFIPass.kext` or EFI boot arguments. They remain part of the user-managed OpenCore EFI.

| Edition | AMFI configuration |
|---|---|
| Preserved Reference Edition | `amfi=0x80` + `ipc_control_port_options=0` |
| amfipassbeta Edition | `AMFIPass.kext` 1.4.1 + `-amfipassbeta` |
| OCLP-CustoMac | `AMFIPass.kext` 1.4.1 + `-amfipassbeta` |

## Why OCLP-CustoMac Exists

OCLP-CustoMac was not created merely to place another OCLP patcher on the market, and it is not intended to replace original Dortania OCLP, OCLP-Mod, or OCLP-Plus.

The project grew from long-term maintenance and real-system validation of the preserved OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly Tahoe environment and its amfipassbeta Edition. Continued Tahoe development exposed requirements that no longer fit cleanly within preservation-only changes:

- independent Modern Wi-Fi and Modern Audio selection;
- safer recovery from installed, pending, and failed root-patch states;
- optional manual KDK selection and KDK eligibility safeguards;
- direct Intel hardware detection;
- APFS patch-resource packaging;
- locked, reproducible, and independently validated builds.

OCLP-Mod and OCLP-Plus were important comparative reference implementations during the audits. OCLP-CustoMac is **not** a copy-and-paste combination of those forks. Comparable concepts were audited against the preserved OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly baseline, then independently reimplemented, adapted, refined, or deliberately rejected according to this project's narrower scope and security boundaries.

Concrete examples include:

- **Intel detection:** reconstructed from the current AirportItlwm matcher and current Intel BZ/SC transport definitions, then cross-checked against OCLP-Mod rather than copied from its table.
- **APFS resources:** the APFS container concept was adopted, but the privileged nested-mount model found in comparative forks was rejected. OCLP-CustoMac uses an unprivileged host-side sibling mount with logical-path compatibility.
- **Root-patch recovery:** independently redesigned following real failed/pending root-state testing.
- **Manual KDK and patch selection:** designed for OCLP-CustoMac's operation-scoped selection and fail-closed resolver architecture.

The result has a different scope, different implementation decisions, and its own static and physical runtime validation record. This is not a claim that it is superior to other OCLP derivatives.

## Three Established Tahoe Approaches

OCLP-CustoMac does not obsolete or withdraw the two earlier KGP Tahoe configurations. All three approaches remain intentionally available.

### 1. OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly – Preserved Reference Edition

Repository: [kgp-macPro/OCLP-lzhoang2801](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/OCLP-lzhoang2801)

- conservative reference environment closest to the earlier working lzhoang2801 OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly Tahoe state;
- uses the earlier working lzhoang2801 PatcherSupportPkg containing Modern Wireless resources and AppleHDA;
- retains the historical `amfi=0x80` and `ipc_control_port_options=0` AMFI path;
- preserved for users who value maximum proximity to the original Nightly architecture.

### 2. OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly – amfipassbeta Edition

Repository: [kgp-macPro/OCLP-lzhoang2801-amfipassbeta](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/OCLP-lzhoang2801-amfipassbeta)

- conservative and extensively tested on real systems over many months;
- remains close to the preserved Nightly architecture;
- uses `AMFIPass.kext` 1.4.1 + `-amfipassbeta`; `amfi=0x80` is not required;
- its documented Intel configuration uses a Broadcom `IOName` spoof with AirportItlwm;
- remains fully available, and satisfied users do not need to migrate.

### 3. OCLP-CustoMac

Repository: [kgp-macPro/OCLP-CustoMac](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/OCLP-CustoMac)

- further-developed focused branch with direct Intel detection;
- does not require a Broadcom `IOName` spoof for Intel detection;
- validated with `AMFIPass.kext` 1.4.1 + `-amfipassbeta`; `amfi=0x80` is not required;
- selectable Modern Wi-Fi and Modern Audio;
- automatic and optional manual KDK selection;
- strengthened root-patch recovery;
- APFS internal resources;
- reproducible, validated builds.

## Public Support Scope

| Environment | Status |
|---|---|
| Custom Mac / Hackintosh, macOS Tahoe 26.x / Darwin 25 | **Fully runtime validated public target** |
| macOS Sequoia / Darwin 24 Modern Wireless | Coherent inherited path and complete resources; not runtime validated or advertised as supported |
| macOS Sonoma / Darwin 23 Modern Wireless | Coherent inherited path and complete resources; not runtime validated or advertised as supported |
| Genuine Apple Intel hardware | Not artificially blocked; unverified and not advertised as supported |
| Darwin 26 / Golden Gate | Outside the current root-patch support scope |

Modern Audio is native/not applicable on Sequoia. Source reachability is not a support promise: Tahoe/Darwin 25 is the first-release support claim.

## Build and Install OpenCore Support Boundary

**Build and Install OpenCore** is an inherited OCLP workflow. OCLP-CustoMac is developed primarily and physically runtime-validated for advanced Custom Mac / Hackintosh Root Patching.

The 3.0.3 packaging correction restores the inherited EFI-builder resources to the component versions already declared by the source. It does not constitute expanded runtime validation or a general support commitment for genuine Apple Intel Macs.

## Root Patch Selection

The Root Patch Selection screen presents applicable controls for:

```text
[✓] Modern Wi-Fi
[✓] Modern Audio
[ ] Manually select Kernel Debug Kit
```

Applicable Modern Wi-Fi and Modern Audio options default ON on a CLEAN root. Supported selections are:

- Wi-Fi + Audio;
- Wi-Fi only;
- Audio only.

With both patch options OFF, **Start Root Patching** is disabled and an explicitly forced empty operation is rejected before KDK, root, kernel-cache, snapshot, or metadata work.

When a known root patch is installed, its applied selection is shown read-only. To change it:

```text
Revert Root Patches
    -> reboot into a CLEAN/sealed root
    -> choose the new configuration
    -> root patch again
```

Selection affects root payloads only. OCLP-CustoMac does not mutate EFI, DeviceProperties, ACPI, DMAR, NVRAM, or hardware identity as a side effect of Modern Wi-Fi selection.

### Pre-Update Resource Preparation

This mechanism can become active while a macOS update is being downloaded or prepared. Its preparation phase was successfully reconstructed: it identifies the upcoming macOS build and determines, prepares, or caches resources that may be required for that target build. **Pre-Update Resource Preparation itself does not apply Root Patches.**

The subsequent update-time process could not be reconstructed completely because the specific historical macOS-update event and evidence needed to trace the full handoff were not captured. In practice, that subsequent behavior had been observed to leave Modern Wi-Fi and Modern Audio available immediately after the update.

Without a verified end-to-end handoff, CustoMac-specific selection semantics could not safely be added to this mechanism. A proper redesign would require a verified way to transport and revalidate individual Modern Wi-Fi, Modern Audio, Manual KDK, and persistent selection state across the complete update-time process. That architecture was not established by the audit, so 3.0.2 deliberately does not redesign the inherited mechanism.

The 3.0.2 change is intentionally limited to removing the inherited ten-second automatic continuation and requiring an explicit **Cancel** or **Continue** decision. No response, closing the dialog, dismissal, or any other non-affirmative result can ever mean Continue.

For OCLP-CustoMac, Pre-Update Resource Preparation is **not** the recommended Root Patch workflow. Normally choose **Cancel**. Choose **Continue** only if you deliberately want to use this inherited automatic update-resource-preparation workflow, Modern Wi-Fi and Modern Audio are both applicable, and you are confident that a suitable and working KDK is available for the target macOS build. The AUTO KDK policy may use an eligible closest match.

### Post-Login Automatic Root Patching

This is a separate and independent mechanism. It runs after login when OCLP-CustoMac detects that the system is currently running without Root Patches; it has no architectural dependency on Pre-Update Resource Preparation.

Before 3.0.2, the prompt already waited for explicit user confirmation and had no timer. After confirmation, however, it bypassed the normal CustoMac Root Patch Selection GUI and used automatic patch selection. On a clean system where both families were applicable, Modern Wi-Fi and Modern Audio were selected together with automatic KDK handling.

In 3.0.2, the prompt offers **Cancel** and **Review Root Patches**. Choosing Review Root Patches opens the normal CustoMac Root Patch Selection GUI, where the user can choose, as applicable:

- Modern Wi-Fi only;
- Modern Audio only;
- Modern Wi-Fi + Modern Audio;
- AUTO KDK;
- Manual KDK.

Root Patching begins only after the user explicitly chooses **Start Root Patching**. The same normal selection GUI remains available manually by opening OCLP-CustoMac and choosing **Post-Install Root Patch**.

## Intel Wi-Fi Device Support

OCLP-CustoMac directly recognizes:

- **87 Regular** Intel PCI IDs from the current authoritative AirportItlwm matcher;
- **9 Experimental / Development** Intel BZ/SC transport IDs;
- **96 total** Intel transport IDs.

[Complete Intel Wi-Fi Device Support List](Documentation/Intel-WiFi-Device-Support.md)

Experimental detection makes the shared Modern Wi-Fi root-patch path applicable. It does **not** guarantee stock AirportItlwm runtime support, and a compatible experimental or modified driver may be required. BZ/SC PCI transport IDs do not necessarily identify a one-to-one marketing SKU: `272B` covers discrete BE200/BE202-family variants differentiated through further subsystem/RF identity, while integrated BE201/BE211/BE213 differentiation may likewise require information beyond the base PCI transport ID.

CNVio, CNVio2, and CNVio3 are not exclusion criteria. The known legacy Centrino Wireless-N/WiMAX 6150 IDs `0885` and `0886` remain deliberately excluded.

### Direct Intel detection—no Broadcom IOName spoof required

Unlike the amfipassbeta Edition, OCLP-CustoMac detects supported Intel hardware from its authentic PCI vendor/device identity and does not require a Broadcom `IOName` spoof for detection.

Intel detection and runtime binding are separate layers:

1. OCLP-CustoMac detects the Intel transport and makes Modern Wi-Fi applicable.
2. The user's external EFI and AirportItlwm bind the physical device at boot.

OCLP-CustoMac does **not**:

- provide, install, or download AirportItlwm;
- modify the user's EFI or `Kernel/Add`;
- inject Broadcom `IOName` or Intel spoofing;
- modify DeviceProperties, ACPI, DMAR, or NVRAM.

Do not blindly remove an existing historical EFI property merely because OCLP-CustoMac no longer needs it for detection. It may serve another system-specific purpose; review the migration context first.

### Validated Intel runtime status

With Intel AX210 (`8086:2725`) and an external AirportItlwm EFI, KGP validated the final pre-publication RC after the GUI-branding cleanup:

- Wi-Fi — working;
- AppleHDA — working;
- AirPlay — working bidirectionally;
- normal Apple Screen Mirroring path — working bidirectionally.

This is **Gate 1 — PASS**.

Current AirportItlwm does not provide a complete native AWDL control/data path. OCLP-CustoMac therefore does not claim reliable Intel support for bidirectional AirDrop, Personal Hotspot, or Continuity Camera. Those limitations belong to the external runtime driver, not to OCLP-CustoMac's PCI detection or shared Modern Wireless root patch.

Normal Screen Mirroring works on the validated Broadcom and Intel paths. Some Hackintosh systems independently reproduce an outgoing Hackintosh-to-Apple-receiver black-screen issue; it is separate from OCLP-CustoMac. [FeatureUnlock-Tahoe](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/FeatureUnlock-Tahoe) is a validated fallback for affected Broadcom setups, while Intel plus [FeatureUnlock-Tahoe](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/FeatureUnlock-Tahoe) remains less reliable and under separate development. Systems with normally working Screen Mirroring do not need [FeatureUnlock-Tahoe](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/FeatureUnlock-Tahoe).

### Final Broadcom runtime gate

After Gate 1, KGP physically replaced AX210 with BCM943602CDP and retained the already-installed final-RC Modern Wireless / Modern Audio root-patch snapshot. Root patches were not reverted or reapplied for the adapter change. AppleHDA, Broadcom Wi-Fi, bidirectional AirDrop, bidirectional AirPlay, bidirectional normal Apple Screen Mirroring, Continuity Camera, and Personal Hotspot all worked immediately after boot.

This **Gate 2 — PASS** result confirms that the shared Modern Wireless root-patch environment is hardware-neutral between the validated Intel and Broadcom paths. It does not represent a new Broadcom Revert -> CLEAN -> Root Patch cycle; Broadcom detection and patch application were separately runtime validated during development, and the final GUI-branding cleanup changed no related functional code.

**Publication runtime gates: COMPLETE.**

### Root Patch runtime validation baseline

The final OCLP-CustoMac 3.0.2 tag build was successfully validated by KGP on the reference system under macOS Tahoe 26.6.2. Version 3.0.3 does not change Root Patch/runtime behavior; the established Intel and Broadcom runtime-validation baseline therefore remains unchanged.

## Kernel Debug Kit Handling

Modern Wi-Fi alone does not require a KDK solely because Wi-Fi is selected. Modern Audio / AppleHDA uses a KDK where its applicable path requires one. Requirement aggregation remains authoritative for any future selected patch that independently requires a KDK.

### Automatic mode

Automatic mode preserves inherited OCLP behavior: exact match when available, otherwise the existing closest-match choice among permitted candidates.

### Manual mode

When the final selected patch plan requires a KDK, the optional **Manually select Kernel Debug Kit** control becomes available. The dialog shows eligible official candidates, version/build, installed status, exact/closest status where applicable, and the candidate OCLP would choose automatically.

The manual selection is operation-scoped and confirmed before use. The exact chosen identity is handed to the normal OCLP download/install/merge/patch workflow. Cancellation starts no KDK or root operation, and a failed manual choice never falls back silently into AUTO.

### Darwin-26 KDK protection

KDK eligibility uses ProductBuildVersion/build family—not the macOS marketing version:

```text
macOS 26.6.2 / KDK build 25G82  -> permitted
KDK build 26A5368g              -> rejected
```

All KDK candidates whose build identity begins with `26` are excluded. Darwin 25 and older permitted candidates retain inherited exact/closest ranking. Darwin 26 itself is outside the current root-patch scope.

## Root Patch Recovery

OCLP-CustoMac separates authorization to apply a new patch from authorization to recover a root:

- a clean, patch-authorized root does not need Revert;
- a patched, pending, failed, or otherwise non-clean root that blocks new patching exposes **Revert Root Patches** as the recovery path.

Recovery is not artificially restricted by Git commit, application build, project/fork identity, patchset identity, KDK identity, trusted installed-selection metadata, or lifecycle-record presence.

True safeguards remain enforced at click and operation time, including SIP/`can_unpatch`, target-root validation, state revalidation, and the standard last-sealed-snapshot rollback. Failed and pending patch operations retain a recovery path instead of creating a Patch-off/Revert-off dead end.

## Validated Tahoe Configuration

The KGP runtime-validation baseline used:

```text
AMFIPass                1.4.1
boot argument           -amfipassbeta
SecureBootModel         Disabled
csr-active-config       03080000
DisableIoMapper         true
```

`amfi=0x80` is not required for this configuration. `-amfipassbeta` is **not deprecated**.

This is the validated project baseline, not an instruction to rewrite an existing EFI without reviewing the complete hardware and security context.

## Component / Build Baseline

| Component | Version |
|---|---:|
| OpenCorePkg | 1.0.7 |
| Lilu | 1.7.2 |
| WhateverGreen | 1.7.0 |
| RestrictEvents | 1.1.6 |
| AirportBrcmFixup | 2.2.0 |
| BlueToolFixup | 2.7.2 |
| NVMeFix | 1.1.3 |
| CPUFriend | 1.3.0 |
| CryptexFixup | 1.0.5 |
| DebugEnhancer | 1.1.1 |
| AppleALC | 1.9.7 |
| FeatureUnlock | 1.1.8 (stock baseline) |
| AMFIPass | **1.4.1 (intentionally pinned)** |

These versions describe the OCLP-CustoMac build/component baseline. OCLP-CustoMac does not automatically update or rewrite the user's EFI.

## Installation and Package Security

OCLP-CustoMac packages are ad-hoc signed and are not distributed with Apple Developer ID signing or Apple notarization.

First verify the package against the SHA-256 published with the official release:

```sh
shasum -a 256 OpenCore-Patcher.pkg
```

If macOS quarantine blocks that verified package, remove quarantine metadata only from the selected artifact:

```sh
xattr -cr ./OpenCore-Patcher.pkg
```

For the uninstaller:

```sh
xattr -cr ./OpenCore-Patcher-Uninstaller.pkg
```

OCLP-CustoMac does **not** require Gatekeeper to be disabled system-wide. `xattr -cr` removes quarantine metadata from the named package; use it only on an official, hash-verified artifact. A targeted GUI quarantine-removal utility may be used as an optional alternative, but it does not replace checksum verification.

Technical compatibility filenames remain `OpenCore-Patcher.app`, `OpenCore-Patcher.pkg`, and `OpenCore-Patcher-Uninstaller.pkg`.

## APFS Patch Resources

Both protected resource images use APFS:

```text
payloads.dmg            = APFS
Universal-Binaries.dmg = APFS
```

The HFS+-to-APFS conversion preserved the logical payload tree. Complete root patching and Revert were runtime validated with the APFS resources. The runtime mount architecture remains unprivileged: the inner resource image mounts at a host-side sibling location and is exposed through the expected logical path without adding a general-purpose privileged nested-mount helper. Protected-image authentication uses the noninteractive stdin-passphrase path.

## Tahoe Payload Provenance

Two complete PatcherSupportPkg lines are intentionally preserved for the three Tahoe approaches.

### Why complete working resources are required

The final publicly released lzhoang2801 OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly configuration references a newer PatcherSupportPkg that no longer contains the Tahoe `AppleHDA.kext` expected by its included Modern Audio patch definition. When Modern Audio is applicable, that final published configuration cannot complete the expected Tahoe root patch because the required payload is absent.

The preserved working configurations therefore use complete resource sources instead.

### Preserved Reference Edition

The Preserved Reference Edition uses an earlier working lzhoang2801 PatcherSupportPkg containing both the required Modern Wireless payloads and `AppleHDA.kext`. Its relevant Modern Wireless framework variants are the earlier ad-hoc-signed payloads, paired with the historical `amfi=0x80` and `ipc_control_port_options=0` configuration.

### amfipassbeta Edition and OCLP-CustoMac

These use a KGP-maintained derivative of the PatcherSupportPkg preserved by laobamac:

https://github.com/kgp-macPro/PatcherSupportPkg-laobamac

The laobamac-preserved line provides the non-ad-hoc-signed Modern Wireless framework variants used with `AMFIPass.kext + -amfipassbeta`. Because `AppleHDA.kext` was also absent from that preserved package, KGP restored it **unchanged** from the earlier working lzhoang2801 PatcherSupportPkg.

### Verified relationship of consumed payloads

The audit did **not** establish that the two complete PatcherSupportPkg repositories are globally byte-identical. It established equivalence only for resources consumed by the enabled Modern Wireless and Modern Audio patchsets:

- `wifip2pd` is byte-identical between the compared working package variants;
- the restored `AppleHDA.kext` is byte-identical to the earlier working lzhoang2801 Tahoe payload;
- five relevant framework executables retain identical architectures, paths, permissions, and executable `__text` sections:
  - `IO80211`;
  - `IO80211Old.dylib`;
  - `LibSystemShim.dylib`;
  - `WiFiPeerToPeer`;
  - `WiFiPeerToPeerOld.dylib`;
- relevant differences in those framework binaries are confined to embedded code-signature and associated link-edit metadata;
- the earlier lzhoang2801 variants are ad-hoc signed;
- the laobamac-derived variants contain non-ad-hoc embedded signatures.

The payload definitions and consumed functional content remain preserved. OCLP-CustoMac's control logic has been substantially improved; the historical statement that no patcher logic changed no longer describes this project.

## AppleVTD / IOMMU

The fully validated configuration uses `DisableIoMapper=true`. AppleVTD operation with `DisableIoMapper=false` remains post-release research and is not a release requirement.

The pre-publication audit found no grounded localized OCLP-only fix for Broadcom. Intel investigation additionally reaches AirportItlwm's PCI, DMA, and IOMMU behavior. This release does not modify DMAR, the XHC14 Reserved Memory Region, DeviceProperties, ACPI, IOMMU settings, or the user's EFI.

**Broadcom / AppleVTD:** The fully validated OCLP-CustoMac 3.0.3 baseline
above uses `DisableIoMapper=true`. Users who want to keep AppleVTD/IOMMU
enabled with the supported legacy Broadcom configuration under macOS Tahoe
can instead use the independent experimental
[BroadcomVTD-Tahoe](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/BroadcomVTD-Tahoe)
project (`BroadcomVTD.kext`). OCLP-CustoMac restores the Modern Wireless
root-patch environment; BroadcomVTD-Tahoe addresses the additional
kernel-resident Tahoe runtime DMA/IOMMU compatibility problem observed when
the restored AirPortBrcmNIC stack operates with AppleVTD enabled.

## Existing amfipassbeta Edition Users

Migration is optional. The amfipassbeta Edition remains available, and `AMFIPass.kext + -amfipassbeta` remains valid.

Recommended controlled migration:

```text
Revert existing root patches
    -> reboot CLEAN/sealed
    -> install OCLP-CustoMac
    -> retain AMFIPass.kext + -amfipassbeta
    -> choose Modern Wi-Fi / Modern Audio
    -> root patch
    -> reboot
```

For Intel, an old Broadcom `IOName` spoof used solely for predecessor detection is no longer required by OCLP-CustoMac. Review the complete EFI migration guidance before removing historical DeviceProperties that may have other purposes.
